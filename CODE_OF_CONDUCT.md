- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will respond to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If such behavior continues, maintainers may take actions including warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal from the project.
